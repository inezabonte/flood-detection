        <h2>PROBLEM ASSESMENT</h2>
        <p>
          According to the ministry in charge of emergency management in Rwanda,
          at least 65 people died in floods and landslides in Rwanda after
          torrential rain in between March and May 2020. The frequency,
          intensity and impact of natural hazard events are growing and causing
          more disasters with negative impacts on humans, economy and
          environment. Floods and landslides have been amongst the major
          disasters in Rwanda. Floods and landslides frequently affect localised
          areas of Rwanda and most of the affected people do not have efficient
          mechanisms to cope with natural hazards.

        <p>
          In addition, the hilly topography and high annual precipitation rates
          with overexploitation of the natural environment such as
          deforestation, inappropriate farming and poor housing techniques
          accelerate the disaster risks and hence result into loss of lives and
          damages to property. According to MINEMA the most vulnerable areas
          prone to landslides and floods are located in the north-western parts
          namely Nyabihu, Ngororero, Rubavu, Musanze, Burera and Gakenke.

        <h2>GOALS</h2>
        <p>
          Rwanda is a hilly country that experiences several cases of flooding
          annually. Our goal is to provide historical data on flood cases in
          Rwanda in a user-friendly way that is easy to understand. The solution
          that we came up with was to create a data visualisation map that shows
          historical data on the damages caused by floods in Rwanda. This
          solution will assist government authorities to make data led decisions
          in allocating resources according to places that have been affected
          most by the floods.
