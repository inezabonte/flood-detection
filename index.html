    <h4>PROBLEM ASSESMENT</h4>
    <p>According to the ministry in charge of emergency management in Rwanda, at least 65 people died in floods and landslides in Rwanda a:er torren;al rain in between March and May 2020. The frequency, intensity and impact of natural hazard events are growing and causing more disasters with nega;ve impacts on humans, economy and environment. Floods and landslides have been amongst the major disasters in Rwanda.  Floods and landslides frequently affect localised areas of Rwanda and most of the affected people do not have efficient mechanisms to cope with natural hazards. </p><br><br>

    <p>In addi;on ,the hilly topography and high annual precipita;on rates with overexploita;on of the natural environment such as deforesta;on, inappropriate farming and poor housing techniques accelerate the disaster risks and hence result into loss of lives and damages to property. According to MINEMA the most vulnerable areas prone to landslides and floods are located in the north-western parts namely Nyabihu, Ngororero, Rubavu, Musanze, Burera and Gakenke.</p><br><br>
       <h4>GOALS</h4>
       <p>Rwanda is a hilly country that experiences several cases of flooding annually. Our goal is to provide historical data on flood cases in Rwanda in a user-friendly way that is easy to understand. The solu;on that we came up with was to create a data visualisa;on map that shows historical data on the damages caused by floods in Rwanda. This solu;on will assist government authori;es to make data led decisions in alloca;ng resources according to places that have been affected most by the floods. </p><br><br>
       <h4>BENEFICIARIES </h4>
       <ul>
       <li>Decision makers such as government </li>
       <li>Civil Society such as development NGOs </li>
       <li>Academia such as schools and researchers</li>
       </ul>
